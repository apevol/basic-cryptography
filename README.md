# basic-cryptography
Basic cryptography encoding/decoding methods written in Python.

## Caesar Cipher
The caesar cipher is very simple. It takes two inputs, a message, and a shift. With these two values, 
the shift is added on to the index of the current character in the alphabet e.g. a shift of 1 A becomes B.

## Morse Code Translation
The morse code translation simply maps the alphanumeric keys to morse code values, and either encodes or 
decodes this information.

## Public Key Cryptography
